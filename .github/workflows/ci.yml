# .github/workflows/ci.yml

# This workflow defines the Continuous Integration (CI) process for Ctrovalidate.
# It ensures that every push and pull request is automatically tested and built.

name: Ctrovalidate CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  
  # Triggers the workflow on pull request events to the "main" branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This job is named "test-and-build"
  test-and-build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Define the Node.js versions to test against. 
    # Using a matrix allows us to easily test on multiple versions.
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18.x, 20.x] # Test on current and next LTS versions

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # 1. Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Sets up the specified version of Node.js
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          cache: 'npm' # Enable caching for npm dependencies

      # 3. Installs dependencies using 'npm ci' for clean, reproducible builds
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # 4. NEW: Run linter to check for code quality and style issues
      - name: Run linter
        run: npm run lint

      # 5. Runs the test suite using the 'test' script from package.json
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      # 6. Runs the production build using the 'build' script from package.json
      # This is a critical step to ensure the library can be successfully bundled.
      - name: Run production build
        run: npm run build
