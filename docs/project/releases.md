# Release Policy & Changelog

Ctrovalidate follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) for predictable, reliable updates.

## Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

Ctrovalidate follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). This means that our version numbers have specific meanings:

- **MAJOR version** (e.g., `3.0.0`): Will be incremented for incompatible API changes (breaking changes). These will always be accompanied by a detailed migration guide.
- **MINOR version** (e.g., `2.1.0`): Will be incremented when new functionality is added in a backward-compatible manner.
- **PATCH version** (e.g., `2.0.1`): Will be incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes.

You can rely on this scheme to upgrade safely between minor and patch versions.

## Changelog

All notable changes, including new features, bug fixes, and breaking changes, are documented in the `CHANGELOG.md` file in our repository.
