# Localization (i18n)

Ctrovalidate provides a centralized, isomorphic `Translator` system in the `@ctrovalidate/core` package. It allows you to manage error messages for multiple languages and dynamically switch locales across your entire application.

---

## 🏗️ The Global Translator

The `translator` instance is shared across all packages. When you change the locale in the core, the browser and framework adapters react immediately.

```javascript
import { translator } from '@ctrovalidate/core';

// Switch to French
translator.setLocale('fr');
```

---

## 🛠️ Registering Custom Locales

You can add support for new languages by providing a dictionary object that maps rule names to translated messages.

```javascript
translator.addMessages('es', {
  required: 'Este campo es obligatorio.',
  email: 'Por favor, introduce un correo electrónico válido.',
  minLength: 'Debe tener al menos {0} caracteres.'
});

translator.setLocale('es');
```

---

## 🧩 Message Interpolation

Messages support dynamic placeholders using the `{n}` syntax, where `n` corresponds to the index of the rule parameter.

- **Rule**: `minLength:8`
- **Message**: `Must be at least {0} characters.`
- **Result**: `Must be at least 8 characters.`

For rules with multiple parameters (like `between:18,65`):

- **Message**: `Value must be between {0} and {1}.`
- **Result**: `Value must be between 18 and 65.`

---

## 🚀 Contextual Overrides

While global i18n is powerful, you often need to override messages for a specific field without touching the global dictionary.

### In HTML (Browser)

```html
<input 
  name="username" 
  data-ctrovalidate-rules="required" 
  data-ctrovalidate-message="Your username is required to login." 
/>
```

### In Schemas (Core/React/Vue)

```javascript
const schema = {
  username: [
    { name: 'required', message: 'Custom local message' }
  ]
};
```

## ✅ Best Practices

- **Shared Dictionaries**: Keep your translation objects in a separate `i18n/` directory to facilitate contribution and maintenance.
- **Fallback**: Ctrovalidate includes a built-in English fallback. If a rule is missing in your custom locale, it will gracefully revert to English.
- **Dynamic Switching**: In SPAs, listen for your app's language change event and call `translator.setLocale()` accordingly.
