# .gitignore

# Dependencies
# This folder contains all the packages we installed via npm (like Vite and Vitest).
# It can be very large and should always be ignored. Anyone who clones the project
# can regenerate it by simply running `npm install`.
/node_modules

# Build output
# This folder contains the final, generated library files. We don't typically
# commit this to the repository because it's generated from the source code.
# The CI/CD workflow on GitHub will build it automatically to verify it works.
